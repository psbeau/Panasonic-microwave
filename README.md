Thank you for purchasing a Panasonic Microwave Oven.
Your oven is rated 1000 Watts (IEC). When using other cookbooks remember to 
adjust cooking times accordingly. The symbol indicates the heating category for your 
oven when cooking or reheating convenience foods.
Your oven is rated ‘E’, which is very efficient. It is therefore very important that you 
refer carefully to the packet instructions on convenience foods.
Some packet instructions only display information for B or D rated ovens. We 
therefore provide additional guidelines for reheating and cooking on pages 97-112
of this book.
Always check the progress of the food as it cooks or reheats by simply opening 
the door. After checking the progress of the foods, Press the Dial to continue the 
cooking time.
Failure to follow the instructions given in this operating instruction, may affect the 
recipe result and in some instances may be dangerous.

Care & Cleaning of Your Oven 
3. After using Grill, Oven, Steam, 
and Combination cooking the 
walls of the oven should be 
cleaned with a soft cloth and 
soapy water. Particular care 
should be taken to keep the 
window area clean especially 
after cooking by Grill, Oven, 
Steam, and Combination. 
Stubborn spots inside the oven 
can be removed by using a 
small amount of conventional 
oven-cleaner sprayed onto a soft 
damp cloth. Wipe onto problem 
spots, leave for recommended 
time and then wipe off. Do not 
spray directly inside the oven.
4. After cooking with a steam 
function, wipe away any 
excess water which may have 
condensed within the oven 
cavity. Empty the drip tray (refer 
to page 20).
5. Do not use harsh abrasive 
cleaners or sharp metal scrapers 
to clean the oven door glass
since they may scratch the 
surface, which may result in 
shattering of the glass.
6. The outside oven surface
should be cleaned with a damp 
cloth. To prevent damage to the 
operating parts inside the oven, 
water should not be allowed 
to seep into the ventilation 
openings.

panel, leave the oven door 
open to prevent the oven from 
accidentally turning on. After 
cleaning tap Stop/Cancel pad to 
clear the display window.
8. If steam accumulates inside or 
around the outside of the oven 
door, wipe with a soft cloth. This 
may occur when the microwave 
oven is operated under high 
humidity conditions and in no 
way indicates a malfunction of 
the unit or microwave leakage.
9. The oven cavity floor should be 
cleaned regularly. Simply wipe 
the bottom surface of the oven 
with mild detergent and warm 
water then dry with a clean cloth. 
Cooking vapours collect during 
repeated use but in no way 
affect the bottom surface.
10. When Grilling or cooking by 
Oven, Steam or Combination
some foods may splatter grease 
onto the oven walls. If the oven 
is not cleaned to eliminate this 
grease, it can accumulate and 
cause the oven to ‘smoke’
during use. These marks will be 
more difficult to clean later. 
17
Care & Cleaning of Your Oven 
11. A steam cleaner is not to be 
used for cleaning the appliance.
12. Ensure the Grill Tray is kept 
clean, especially when using 
Combination programs.

in the oven, tap Stop/Cancel pad 
and leave the door closed in order 
to stifle any flames. Disconnect the 
power cord, or shut off power at the 
fuse or the circuit breaker panel.
Short Cooking Times
As microwave cooking times are 
much shorter than other cooking 
methods it is essential that 
recommended cooking times are 
not exceeded without first checking 
the food.
Cooking times given in the charts 
are approximate. Factors that may 
affect cooking times are: preferred 
degree of cooking, starting 
temperature, altitude, volume, size 
and shape of foods and utensils 
used. As you become familiar with 
the oven, you will be able to adjust 
these factors. 
It is better to initially undercook 
rather than overcook foods. If food 
is undercooked, it can always be 
returned to the oven for further 
cooking. If food is overcooked, 
nothing can be done. Always start 
with minimum cooking times.
Small Quantities of Food
Take care when heating small 
quantities of food as these can 
easily burn, dry out or catch fire if 
cooked too long. Always set short 
cooking times and check the food 
frequently.
If the recommended cooking 
times are exceeded the food 
will be spoiled and in extreme 
circumstances could catch fire 
and possibly damage the interior 
of the oven.
Important
Never operate the oven without 
food inside on Microwave or 
Combination mode involving 
microwave.
Note
Food Low in Moisture
Take care when heating foods 
low in moisture, e.g. bread items, 
chocolate, biscuits and pastries. 
These can easily burn, dry out or 
catch on fire if cooked too long. We 
do not recommend heating foods 
low in moisture such as popcorn or 
poppadoms. The microwave oven 
is intended for heating food and 
beverages only. Drying of food, 
newspapers or clothing and heating 
of warming pads, slippers, sponges, 
damp cloth, wheat bags, hot water 
bottles and similar may lead to risk 
of injury, ignition or fire.
Christmas Pudding
Christmas puddings and other foods 
high in fats or sugar, e.g. jam, mince 
pies, must not be overheated. 
These foods must never be left 
unattended as with over cooking 
these foods can ignite.
23
Important Information
Liquids
When heating liquids, e.g. soup, 
sauces and beverages in your 
microwave oven, overheating the 
liquid beyond boiling point can 
occur without evidence of bubbling.
This could result in a sudden boil 
over of the hot liquid. To prevent this 
possibility the following steps should 
be taken:
 Avoid using straight-sided 
containers with narrow necks.
 Do not overheat.
 Stir the liquid before placing the 
container in the oven and again 
halfway through the heating time.
 After heating, allow to stand in 
the oven for a short time, stirring 
again before carefully removing 
the container.
Microwave heating of beverages 
can result in delayed eruptive 
boiling, therefore care should be 
taken when handling the container.
Lids
Always remove the lids of jars and 
containers and takeaway food 
containers before you microwave 
them. If you don’t then steam and 
pressure might build up inside and 
cause an explosion even after the 
microwave cooking has stopped.
Deep Fat Frying
Do not attempt to deep fat fry in 
your oven.
Meat Thermometer
Use a meat thermometer to check 
the degree of cooking of roasts and 
poultry only when meat has been 
removed from the microwave. If 
undercooked, return to the oven 
and cook for a few more minutes 
at the recommended power level. 
Do not leave a conventional meat 
thermometer in the oven when 
microwaving.
Boiled Eggs 
Eggs in their shell and whole 
hardboiled eggs should not be 
heated in microwave ovens since 
they may explode even after 
microwave heating has ended.
Foods with Skins 
Potatoes, apples, egg yolk, whole 
vegetables and sausages are 
examples of food with non porous 
skins. These must be pierced using 
a fork before cooking to prevent 
bursting.
Liquids and other foods must not 
be heated in sealed containers 
since they are liable to explode.
Warning!
24
Important Information
Paper, Plastic
When heating food in plastic or 
paper containers, keep an eye on 
the oven due to the possibility of 
ignition. Do not use wire twist-ties 
with roasting bags when cooking 
mode includes microwave power 
as arcing will occur. Do not use 
recycled paper products, e.g. 
Kitchen roll unless they say they 
are specifically designed for use in 
a microwave oven. These products 
contain impurities which may cause 
sparks and/or fires when used.
Reheating
It is essential that reheated food 
is served “piping hot”. Remove 
the food from the oven and check 
that it is “piping hot”, i.e. steam is 
being emitted from all parts and 
any sauce is bubbling. (If you wish 
you may choose to check the food 
has reached 72 °C with a food 
thermometer – but remember do 
not use this thermometer inside the 
microwave.)
For foods that cannot be stirred, e.g. 
lasagne, shepherds pie, the centre 
should be cut with a knife to test 
it is well heated through. Even if a 
manufacturer’s packet instructions 
have been followed always check 
the food is piping hot before serving 
and if in doubt return your food to 
the oven for further heating.
Standing Time
Standing time refers to the period 
at the end of cooking or reheating 
when food is left before being eaten, 
i.e. it is a rest time which allows 
the heat in the food to continue 
to conduct to the centre, thus 
eliminating cold spots.
Keeping Your Oven Clean 
It is essential for the safe operation 
of the oven that it is wiped out 
regularly. Use warm soapy water, 
squeeze the cloth out well and 
use to remove any grease or food 
from the interior. Pay particular 
attention to the door seal area. The 
oven should be unplugged when 
cleaning.
Grilling
The oven will only operate on the 
Grill function with the door closed.
Fan Motor Operation 
After using the microwave oven, the 
fan motor may operate to cool the 
electric components. This is normal 
and you can take out food even 
though the fan motor operates. You 
can continue using the oven during 
this time.
25
Important Information
Microwaves are present in the 
atmosphere all the time, both 
naturally and from manmade 
sources. Manmade sources 
include radar, radio, television, 
telecommunication links and mobile 
phones.

the oven
Utensils/Containers 
Before use check that utensils/
containers are suitable for use in 
microwave ovens. See pages 
33-34.
Storage of Accessories
Do not store any objects other than 
oven accessory inside the oven in 
case it is accidentally turned on. 
Babies Bottles and Food Jars
When reheating babies bottles 
always remove top and teat. 
Liquid at the top of the bottle 
will be much hotter than that at 
the bottom and must be shaken 
thoroughly before checking the 
temperature. The lid must also be 
removed from babies food jars, 
the contents must also be stirred 
or shaken before the temperature 
is checked. This should be carried 
out before consumption in order to 
avoid burns. See pages 95-96.
Arcing 
Arcing may occur if a metal 
container has been used incorrectly, 
if the incorrect weight of food is 
used, or if the accessories have 
been damaged. Arcing is when 
blue flashes of light are seen in 
the microwave oven. If this occurs, 
stop the machine immediately. If 
the oven is left unattended and 
this continues it can damage the 
machine. You can continue to cook 
by Grill, Oven or Steam only.
In a microwave oven, electricity is 
converted into microwaves by the 
Magnetron. For bottom feeding, 
please refer to page 43.
Microwaving Principles
26
Microwaving Principles
Transmission
Then they pass through the cooking 
containers to be absorbed by the 
water molecules in the food, all 
foods contain water to a more or 
lesser extent.
Reflection
The microwaves bounce off the 
metal walls and the metal door 
screen.
The dish used to cook or 
reheat the food will get warm 
during cooking, as the heat 
conducts from the food. Even 
in microwaving, oven gloves 
are required! Microwaves 
can not pass through metal 
and therefore metal cooking 
utensils can never be used in 
a microwave, for cooking on 
microwave only.
Important Notes
How Microwaves Cook Food
The microwaves cause the water 
molecules to vibrate which causes 
friction, i.e. heat. This heat then 
cooks the food. 
Microwaves are also attracted 
to fat and sugar particles, and 
Do not boil eggs in your 
microwave. Raw eggs boiled 
in their shells can explode and 
cause serious injury.
Boiled eggs
foods high in these will cook more 
quickly. Microwaves can only 
penetrate to a depth of 4-5 cm 
and as heat spreads through the 
food by conduction, just as in a 
traditional oven, the food cooks 
from the outside inwards.
Foods Not Suitable for Cooking by Microwave Only
Yorkshire pudding and souffles. 
This is because these foods 
rely on dry external heat to cook 
correctly, do not attempt to cook 
by microwave.
Foods that require deep fat frying 
cannot be cooked either.
Standing Time
When a microwave oven is 
switched off, the food will continue 
to cook by conduction – not 
by microwave energy. Hence 
standing time is very important 
in microwaving, particularly for 
dense foods i.e. meat, cakes and 
reheated meals (refer to page 29).

 Moisture Content
Many fresh foods e.g. vegetables 
and fruit, vary in their moisture 
content throughout the season. 
Jacket potatoes are a particular 
example of this. For this reason 
cooking times may have to be 
adjusted throughout the year. Dry 
ingredients e.g. rice, pasta, can dry 
out during storage so cooking times 
may differ from ingredients freshly 
purchased.
 Piercing
The skin or membrane on some 
foods will cause steam to build up 
during cooking. These foods must 
be pierced or a strip of skin should 
be peeled off before cooking to 
allow the steam to escape. Eggs, 
potatoes, apples, sausages etc, 
will all need to be pierced before 
cooking. Do not attempt to boil 
eggs in their shells.
General Guidelines
Standing Time 
Dense foods e.g. meat, jacket 
potatoes and cakes, require a 
standing time (inside or outside 
of the oven) after cooking, to allow 
heat to finish conducting through 
the food.
 Meat Joints
Stand for 15 minutes 
wrapped in aluminium foil.
 Plated Meals 
Stand for 2-3 minutes. 
 Vegetables
Boiled potatoes benefit from 
standing for 1-2 minutes, 
however most other types 
of vegetables can be served 
immediately.
 Defrosting 
It is essential to allow 
standing time to complete the 
process. This can vary from 
5 minutes e.g. raspberries, 
to up to 1 hour for a joint of 
meat. See pages 45-46.
If food is not cooked after 
standing time, return to oven 
and cook for additional time.
 Jacket Potatoes
Wrapped in aluminium foil 
when cooked by microwave 
only. Stand for 15 minutes.
It is not necessary to stand 
jacket potatoes cooked in 
combination mode.
 Fish
Stand for 2-3 minutes. 
 Egg Dishes
Stand for 1-2 minutes. 
 Precooked Convenience 
Food
Stand for 1-2 minutes. 
30
 Cling Film
Cling film helps keep the food moist 
and the trapped steam assists 
in speeding up cooking times. 
However it should be pierced before 
cooking, to allow excess steam to 
escape. Always take care when 
removing cling film from a dish as 
the build-up of steam will be very 
hot. Always purchase cling film that 
states on the packet “suitable for 
microwave cooking” and use as a 
covering only. Do not line dishes 
with cling film. Do not cover foods 
when cooking by Grill, Oven or 
Combination.
 Dish Size
Follow the dish sizes given in the 
recipes, as these affect the cooking 
and reheating times. A quantity of 
food spread in a bigger dish cooks 
and reheats more quickly.
General Guidelines 
 Quantity
Small quantities cook faster than 
large quantities, also small meals 
will reheat more quickly than large 
portions.
 Spacing
Foods cook more quickly and 
evenly if spaced apart. Never pile 
foods on top of each other.
 Shape
Even shapes cook evenly. Food 
cooks better by microwave when 
in a round container rather than 
square.
 Density
Porous airy foods heat more quickly 
than dense heavy foods.
 Covering
Cover foods with microwave cling 
film or a self-fitting lid. Cover fish, 
vegetables, casseroles, soups. Do 
not cover cakes, sauces, jacket 
potatoes, pastry items. Please refer 
to cooking charts and recipes for 
more information.
31
General Guidelines 
 Starting 
Temperature
The colder the food, the longer 
it takes to heat up. Food from a 
fridge takes longer to reheat than 
food at room temperature. Food 
temperature should be between 
5-8 °C before cooking.
 Arranging
Individual foods e.g. chicken 
portions or chops, should be placed 
in a dish so that the thicker parts 
are to the outside.
 Ingredients
Foods containing fat, sugar or salt 
heat up very quickly. The filling may 
be much hotter than the pastry. Take 
care when eating. Do not overheat 
even if the pastry does not appear 
to be very hot.
 Turning and 
Stirring 
Some foods require stirring during 
cooking. Meat and poultry should be 
turned after half the cooking time.
 Liquids
All liquids must be stirred before, 
during and after heating. Water 
especially must be stirred before 
and during heating, to avoid 
eruption. Do not heat liquids that 
have previously been boiled. Do 
not overheat.
 Checking Food 
It is essential that food is checked 
during and after a recommended 
cooking time, even if an auto 
program has been used (just as 
you would check food cooked in a 
conventional oven). Return the food 
to the oven for further cooking if 
necessary.
 Cleaning 
As microwaves work on food 
particles, keep your oven clean at 
all times. Stubborn spots of food 
can be removed by using a branded 
oven cleaner, sprayed onto a soft 
cloth. Always wipe the oven dry 
after cleaning. Avoid any plastic 
parts and door area. Customers 
should not spray directly into the 
cavity. 
32
Quick Check Guide to Cooking Utensils
Testing Dishes for Suitability - 
For Microwave Cooking Only.
When unsure that a cooking 
container is suitable for use in 
your microwave, check by the 
following test:
1. Fill a microwave safe measuring 
jug with 300 ml cold water.
2. Place it on the base of the oven 
along side the dish to be tested. 
If the dish you are testing is 
a large dish, then stand the 
measuring jug on top of the 
empty dish.
3. Heat on High Microwave 
(1000 W) for 1 minute.
If the dish is suitable for 
microwaving, it will remain cool, 
whilst the water in the jug will 
begin to feel warm. If the testing 
dish feels warm, do not use as it 
is obviously absorbing microwave 
energy.
This test does not apply to plastic 
or metal based containers e.g. 
Le Creuset®
 style dishes, which 
should not be used as they are 
cast iron covered with enamel.
Result
Note
Choosing the correct 
container is a very 
important factor in 
deciding the success 
or failure of your 
cooking.
33
Containers to Use
 Plastic
Many plastic containers are 
designed for microwave use, but do 
not use for cooking foods high in 
sugar or fat or for foods that require 
long cooking times e.g. brown rice. 
Only use Tupperware®
 containers 
if they are designed for Microwave 
use.
 Pottery, Earthenware, 
Stoneware
If completely glazed, these dishes 
are suitable. Do not use if partially 
glazed or unglazed, since they are 
able to absorb water which in turn 
absorbs microwave energy, making 
the container very hot and slows 
down the cooking of food.
Oven Glass
Everyday glass that is heat resistant 
e.g. Pyrex®
, is ideal for Microwave, 
Oven or Combination cooking. Do 
not use delicate glass or lead crystal 
which may crack or arc.
Do not use Melamine. 
Never cook in margarine 
cartons or yoghurt pots, 
as these will melt with the heat from 
the food. If heatproof they can be 
used for Grill, Oven or Combination 
cooking.
China and Ceramic
Everyday glazed china, porcelain 
or ceramic plates, bowls, mugs and 
cups can be used if they are heat 
resistant. Fine bone china should 
only be used for reheating for short 
periods. Do not use dishes with a 
metal rim or pattern. Do not use 
jugs or mugs with glued handles, 
since the glue can melt. If dishes 
are heat resistant they may be used 
on Oven and Combination but not 
directly under the Grill.
 Foil/Metal 
Containers
Never attempt to cook in foil or 
metal containers on Microwave only 
as the microwaves cannot pass 
through and the food will not heat 
evenly, it may also damage your 
oven. Foil and metal containers can 
be used on Grill or Oven.
34
Only use for short cooking times. 
Never re-use a piece of kitchen 
towel. Always use a fresh piece 
of paper for each dish.
Avoid kitchen paper containing 
manmade fibres. If you are using 
branded re-cycled kitchen towel, 
check first that it is recommended 
for microwave use. Do not use 
waxed or plastic coated cups or 
plates as the finish may melt. 
Greaseproof paper can be used 
to line the base of dishes and to 
cover when blind baking pastry 
cases. White paper plates can be 
used for short reheating times, on 
Microwave only.
 Paper
Plain white absorbent kitchen paper 
(kitchen towel) can only be used for 
microwave cooking e.g. for covering 
bacon to prevent splattering.
Containers to Use
 Wicker, Wood, Straw 
Baskets
Dishes will crack and could ignite. 
Do not use wooden dishes in your 
microwave. Do not use on any 
cooking mode.
 Cling Film
Microwave cling film can only 
be used for covering food that is 
reheated by microwave. It is also 
useful for covering food to be 
cooked, but care should be taken to 
avoid the film being in direct contact 
with the food eg. Do not line dishes 
with cling film. Do not use on any 
other cooking mode.
 Aluminium Foil
Small amounts of smooth aluminium 
foil can be used to shield joints of 
meat during defrosting and cooking 
by Microwave, as the microwaves 
cannot pass through the foil, this 
prevents the parts shielded from 
overcooking or over defrosting. Take 
care that the foil does not touch the 
sides or roof of the oven, as this 
may cause arcing and damage your 
oven. Aluminium foil can be used for 
Oven cooking.
 Roasting Bags
Roasting bags are useful when 
slit up one side to tent a joint, 
for roasting by microwave and 
time. Do not use the metal twists 
supplied, when using Microwave or 
Combination.

Note
Microwave Cooking and Defrosting
1. You can change the cooking time during cooking if required. Turn 
the Dial to increase or decrease the cooking time. Time can be 
increased/decreased in 1 minute increments, up to 10 minutes. 
2. Do not attempt to use microwave only with any metal container in the 
oven.
3. Do not place food directly onto the base of the oven. Place in 
a microwaveable or glass dish. Foods reheated or cooked by 
microwave only should be covered with a lid or pierced cling film, 
unless otherwise stated.
4. For manual defrosting times, please refer to defrost chart on pages 
45-46.
5. For multi-stage cooking refer to pages 61-63.
6. Standing time can be programmed after microwave power and time 
setting. Refer to using the timer pages 66-67.
Bottom feeding technology
Please note that this product uses bottom feeding technology for microwave 
distribution which differs from traditional turntable side feeding methods and 
creates more useable space for a variety of different sized dishes. 
This microwave feeding style can give a difference in heating times 
(in microwave mode) when compared against side feeding appliances. 
This is quite normal and should not cause any concern. Please refer to the 
reheating and cooking charts on pages 97-112.

Defrosting Guidelines
For Best Results
1. Place foods in a suitable 
container. Meat joints and 
chickens should be placed on 
an upturned saucer or on a 
plastic rack if you have one.
2. Check food during defrosting, 
as foods vary in their defrosting 
speed.
3. It is not necessary to cover the 
food.
4. Always turn or stir the food 
especially when the oven 
“beeps”. Shield if necessary (see 
point 6).
5. Minced meat, chops, chicken 
portions and other small 
items should be broken up or 
separated as soon as possible 
and placed in a single layer.
Arrange food in a single layer.
Turn or break up food as soon 
as possible.
Shield chickens and joints of 
meat.
By selecting the Defrost power 
level from the Micro power pad 
and setting a time, you can defrost 
food in your microwave. The 
biggest problem is getting the inside 
defrosted before the outside starts to 
cook.
For this reason a defrost program 
alternates between a defrost power 
and a standing time. The name for 
this type of defrost is cyclic. During 
the standing stages there is not 
any microwave power in the oven, 
although the light will remain on.
The automatic standing time ensure 
a more even defrost but it is still 
necessary to allow for standing 
times before use.
6. Shielding prevents food cooking. 
It is essential when defrosting 
chickens and joints of meat. 
The outside thaws out first, so 
protect wings/breast and fat with 
smooth pieces of aluminium foil 
secured with cocktail sticks.
7. Allow standing time so that the 
centre of the food thaws out. 
(Minimum of 1 hour for joints of 
meat and whole chickens).

Defrosting Charts
The times given below are a guideline only. Always check the progress of

Adjust to Taste
The Sensor Reheat Program reheats a chilled meal or a frozen meal for 
average tastes. You are able to adjust the Sensor Reheat Program to 
your own taste. After pressing the Dial, " / "symbol appears in the 
display,turn Dial clockwise for more time or anticlockwise for less time. This 
operation should be completed within 14 seconds. Default mode is normal.
How it Works
Once the Sensor Reheat Program has been selected and the Dial is 
pressed the food is heating up. As food begins to get hot, steam is emitted. 
When the food reaches a certain temperature and begins to cook, an even 
greater amount of steam is released. The increase in steam emission 
is detected by a humidity sensor in the oven. This acts as a signal for 
the oven to calculate how much longer the food needs to reheat. The 
remaining cooking time will appear in the display window after two beeps. 
Whilst the sensor program is still in the display window the oven door 
should not be opened. Wait until the cooking time appears in the window, 
and then open the door if required, to stir or turn the food.
Note
1. This feature is not suitable for foods that cannot be stirred eg. 
lasagne / macaroni cheese.
2. The oven automatically calculates the reheating time or the remaining 
reheating time.
3. The door should not be opened before the time appears in the 
display window.
4. To prevent any mistakes during Sensor Reheat Programs ensure 
that base of oven and the container are dry.
5. The room temperature should not be more than 35 °C and not less 
than 0 °C.
6. If the oven has previously been used and it is too hot to be used on 
Sensor Reheat Programs, ‘HOT’ will appear in the display window. 
After the ‘HOT’ disappears, the Sensor Reheat Programs may 
be used. If in a hurry, cook food manually by selecting the correct 
cooking mode and cooking time yourself.

Chaos Defrost
This feature allows you to defrost minced meat, chops, chicken 
portions, meat joints and bread. Tap Chaos Defrost pad to select the 
correct defrost category and then enter in the weight of the food in 
grams (see page 88).
Foods should be placed in a suitable dish, whole chickens and joints of 
meat should be on an upturned saucer or on a microwave safe plate. 
Chops, chicken portions and slices of bread should be placed in a single 
layer. It is not necessary to cover the foods.
The Chaos theory principle is used in auto weight defrost programs to give 
you a quick and more even defrost. The Chaos system uses a random 
sequence of pulsing microwave energy which speeds up the defrosting 
process. During the program the oven will beep to remind you to check the 
food. It is essential that you turn and stir the food frequently and shield 
if necessary. On hearing the first beep you should turn and shield (if 
possible). On the second beep you should turn the food or break it up.
Turn Turn or break up Or shield 
1st Beep 1st Beep 2nd Beep
Note
1. Check foods during defrosting. Foods vary in their defrosting speed.
2. It is not necessary to cover the food.
3. Always turn or stir the food especially when the oven “beeps”. Shield 
if necessary (see point 5).
4. Minced meat/chops/chicken portions should be broken up or 
separated as soon as possible and placed in a single layer.
5. Shielding prevents food cooking. It is essential when defrosting 
chickens and joints of meat. The outside thaws out first, so protect 
wings/breast/fat with smooth pieces of aluminium foil secured with 
cocktail sticks.
6. Allow standing time so that the centre of the food thaws out (minimum 
1-2 hours for joints of meat and whole chickens).
7. If ‘HOT’ appears in the display window, the oven temperature is too 
high from previous use and an auto program can not be set. Cooking 
mode and time may still be set manually.

With this feature you can defrost frozen foods according to the weight. Select 
the category and set the weight of the food. The weight is programmed in 
grams. For quick selection, the weight starts from the minimum weight for each 
category.

To defrost rolls, buns, slices of bread 
and loaves. Place on a plate. Select 
program number 28. Enter the weight of 
the bread. Start to defrost. Turn and 
re-arrange at beeps. 
1. Meat items (mince/chops/chicken portions)
Chops and chicken portions should be arranged in a single layer 
and turned frequently during defrosting. It is necessary for mince to 
be broken up frequently during defrosting and this is best carried 
out in a large shallow dish. Standing time 20-30 mins. Not suitable 
for sausages, these can be defrosted manually. Please refer to 
defrosting chart on pages 45-46.
2. Meat joints/Whole chickens
Whole chickens and meat joints will require shielding during 
defrosting especially if it is a particularly fatty piece. This is to prevent 
food starting to cook on the outside edges. Protect wings, breast and 
fat with smooth pieces of aluminium foil secured with cocktail sticks. 
Do not allow the foil to touch the walls of the oven. Standing time 
of at least 1-2 hours should be allowed for joints after defrosting.
3. Bread
This program is suitable for small items which are required for 
immediate use, they may feel warm straight after defrosting. Loaves 
can also be defrosted on this program but these will require standing 
time to allow the centre to thaw out. Standing time can be shortened 
if slices are separated and buns and loaves cut in half. Items should 
be turned during defrosting. Standing time 10 - 30 minutes. A longer 
time may be needed for large loaves. This program is not suitable 
for cream cakes or desserts e.g. cheesecake.
Note
1. The shape and size of the food will determine the maximum weight 
the oven can accommodate.
2. Allow standing time to ensure the food is completely defrosted.
3. If ‘HOT’ appears in the display window, the oven temperature is too 
high from previous use and an auto program can not be set. Cooking 
mode and time may still be set manually.

Cooking and Reheating Guidelines
Most foods reheat very quickly in 
your oven by HIGH power. Meals 
can be brought back to serving 
temperature in just minutes and will 
taste freshly cooked. Always check 
food is piping hot and return to oven 
if necessary. 
As a general rule, always cover wet 
foods, e.g. soups, casseroles and 
plated meals. 
Do not cover dry foods e.g. bread 
rolls, mince pies, sausage rolls etc. 
The charts on pages 97-112 show 
you the best way to cook or reheat 
your favourite foods. The best 
method depends on the type of food 
you are cooking or reheating.
Remember to stir or turn food 
wherever possible during cooking 
or reheating. This ensures even 
cooking or reheating on the outside 
and in the centre.
When is food reheated?
Food that has been reheated or 
cooked should be served “piping 
hot” i.e. steam should be visibly 
emitted from all parts. As long as 
good hygiene practices have been 
followed during the preparation and 
storage of the food, then cooking or 
reheating presents no safety risks. 
Foods that cannot be stirred should 
be cut with a knife to test that they 
are adequately heated throughout. 
Even if a manufacturer’s instructions 
or the times in the chart have been 
followed, it is still important to check 
the food is heated thoroughly. If in 
doubt, always return to the oven for 
further reheating. 
If you cannot find the equivalent 
food in the chart then choose a 
similar type and size listed and 
adjust the cooking time if necessary. 
Plated meals 
Everyone’s appetite varies and 
reheat times depend on meal 
contents. Dense items e.g. mashed 
potato, should be spread out well. 
If a lot of gravy is added, extra time 
may be required. Place denser 
items to the outside of the plate. An 
average plated meal will take 4-7 
minutes on HIGH power to reheat. 
Do not stack meals.
Canned foods
Remove foods from can and place 
in a suitable dish before heating. 
Stir food halfway through cooking 
and again at the end of heating.
Soups
Use a bowl and stir before heating 
and at least once during reheating 
and again at the end.
Casseroles
Stir halfway through and again at 
the end of heating.
96
Cooking and Reheating Guidelines
Caution - Mince pies
Caution - Christmas puddings and liquids
Caution - Babies’ bottles
Remember even if the pastry is cold to the touch, the filling will be piping
hot and will warm the pastry through. Take care not to overheat 
otherwise burning can occur due to the high fat and sugar content of the 
filling. Check the temperature of the filling before consuming to avoid 
burning your mouth.
Take great care when reheating these items.
Do not leave unattended.
Do not add extra alcohol.
Milk or formula must be shaken thoroughly before heating and again 
at the end and tested carefully before feeding a baby. Liquid at the top 
of the bottle will be much hotter than at the bottom. The bottle must be 
shaken thoroughly and tested before use.
Note
We do not recommend that you use your microwave to sterilise 
babies’ bottles. If you have a special microwave steriliser we urge 
extreme caution, due to the low quantity of water involved. It is vital to 
follow the manufacturers' instructions implicitly.
97
Reheating Charts
The times given in the charts below are a guideline only, and will vary 
depending on STARTING temperature, dish size and quantity. Pastry or 
bread items reheated by microwave will be soft not crisp.
Heating category
Your oven is Heating Category E and this is displayed on the rear of your 
oven. The information on this label will assist you in using new instructions 
on food packs to enable you to program the best heating time in your oven.
Points for checking
Always check that food is piping hot after reheating in the microwave. If 
unsure return to oven. Foods will still require a standing time, especially if 
they cannot be stirred. The denser the food the longer the standing time.

Babies bottles – CAUTION
After heating by Microwave, liquid at the top of a bottle will be much hotter 
than at the bottom of the bottle and must be shaken thoroughly before 
checking the temperature. When testing the temperature of the milk, squirt 
a little onto your inner wrist. The milk droplets on your skin should feel 
warm, not hot. 
For 250 ml of milk from fridge temperature, remove top and teat. 
Heat on HIGH Power for 40 secs. CHECK CAREFULLY.
For 100 ml of milk from fridge temperature, remove top and teat.

Questions and Answers
Q: Why won’t my oven turn on?
A: When the oven does not turn on, 
check the following:
1. Is the oven plugged in securely? 
Remove the plug from the outlet, 
wait 10 seconds and reinsert.
2. Check the circuit breaker and 
the fuse. Reset the circuit 
breaker or replace the fuse if it 
is tripped or blown.
3. If the circuit breaker or fuse is 
all right, plug another appliance 
into the outlet. If the other 
appliance works, there probably 
is a problem with the oven. If the 
other appliance does not work, 
there probably is a problem 
with the outlet. If it seems that 
there is a problem with the oven, 
contact an authorised Service 
Centre.
Q: My oven causes interference 
with my TV. Is this normal?
A: Some radio, TV, Wi-Fi, cordless 
telephone, baby monitor, 
blue tooth or other wireless 
equipment interference might 
occur when you cook with 
the microwave oven. This 
interference is similar to the 
interference caused by small 
appliances such as mixers, 
vacuums, blow dryers, etc. It 
does not indicate a problem with 
your oven.
Q: The oven won’t accept my 
program. Why?
A: The oven is designed not to 
accept an incorrect program. 
For example, the oven will not 
accept a fourth stage.
Q: Sometimes warm air comes 
from the oven vents. Why?
A: The heat given off from the 
cooking food warms the air in 
the oven cavity. This warmed 
air is carried out of the oven by 
the air flow pattern in the oven. 
There are no microwaves in the 
air. The oven vents should never 
be blocked during cooking.
Q: I can’t set an auto cook 
program and ‘HOT’ appears in 
the display. Why?
A: If ‘HOT’ appears in the display 
window, the oven temperature is 
too high from previous use and 
an auto program can not be set. 
Cooking mode and time may still 
be set manually.
Q: Can I use a conventional oven 
thermometer in the oven?
A: Only when you are using grill/
oven cooking modes. The 
metal in some thermometers 
may cause arcing in your oven 
and should not be used on 
microwave and combination with 
Microwave cooking modes.
114
Questions and Answers
Q: There are humming and 
clicking noises from my oven 
when I cook by combination. 
What is causing these noises?
A: The noises occur as the oven 
automatically switches from 
microwave power to grill/oven to 
create the combination setting. 
This is normal.
Q: My oven has an odour and 
generates smoke when using 
the combination, oven and 
grill function. Why?
A: After repeated use, it is 
recommended to clean the oven 
and then run F3 Deodorization.
Q: The oven stops cooking by 
microwave and"H97","H98" or 
"H00" appears in the display. 
Why?
A: This display indicates a problem 
with the microwave generation 
system. Please contact an 
authorised Service Centre. 
Q: The fan continues to rotate 
after cooking. Why?
A: After using the oven, the fan 
motor may rotate to cool the 
electrical components. This is 
normal and you can continue 
using the oven at this time.
Q: Can I check the pre-set oven 
temperature while cooking by 
oven?
A: Yes. Tap Oven pad and the oven 
temperature will appear in the 
display window for 2 seconds.
Q: “DEMO MODE PRESS ANY 
KEY” appears in the display 
and the oven does not cook. 
Why?
A: The oven has been programmed 
in demo mode. This mode is 
designed for retail store display. 
Deactivate this mode by tap 
Micro Power once and Stop/
Cancel 4 times.
Q: The operation guide has 
disappeared on my display, I 
can only see numbers. Why?
A: The operation guide was turned 
off by tapping Timer/Clock 4 
times. When colon or time of day 
is displayed, tap Timer/Clock 4 
times to turn the operation guide 
back on.
Q: The oven stops cooking by 
steam or combination with 
steam and U14 appears in the 
display.
A: The water tank is empty and 
the operation guide has been 
turned off. Re-fill the water 
tank, position back in the oven 
and press the Dial to resume 
cooking. If this happens 3 times 
during operation, cooking will 
stop. Press Stop/Cancel to 
reset.
Q: The control panel keys do not 
respond when tapped. Why?
A: Ensure the oven is plugged in.
